# JavaSnake #

## BACKGROUND ##
First seen around 1976, Snake is a generic name for any game where the player controls a  
line which becomes steadily longer. As the game progreses, the player must maneuver so  
that they do not run into the border of the game, or the body of the Snake. Countless  
versions of Snake have been written over the years, in numerous programming languages.  

## INSTRUCTIONS ##
* The game is over when the head of the snake collides with the edge of the grid, or
with the body of the snake
* Control the head of the snake (Red) with WASD or ARROW KEYS
* Collect Coins (Yellow) to increase your score
* The snake will lengthen as the score increases
* Score is displayed in the console once the game is over
